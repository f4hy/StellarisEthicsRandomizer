    <p>This is meant to randomize settings for a stellaris game. Players can
    vote on game settings and settings will be randomly picked in the range
    which players vote. Optionally one ethic for each player will be randomly
    selected.  Given a game id and empire name the choice is random but
    <i>deterministic</i>. This way players do not have to reveal to
    others which ethics they must play, but upon meeting in game
    one can verify a player obeyed the requirement.</p>
